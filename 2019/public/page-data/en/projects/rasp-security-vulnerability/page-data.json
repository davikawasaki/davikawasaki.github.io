As a proof of concept, this project uses a DHT11 sensor with Raspberry Pi, showing real-time temperatures in a mobile application.","In detail, the project covers an IoT devices network using HTTP transmission between two Raspberry Pi 3 B model. One of the Rasps collects the sensor temperature and the other one acts like a webserver with Flask to provide the temperature data to a mobile device. Through the mobile application developed with VueJS 2 and PWA boilerplate, the user can check if there's a fire directly from his/her phone.","As security will be in check, network transmissions will always have a Darth reading and modifying the collected data. The proposed solution aims to fight Darth (not Vader, but as evil as him) to ensure data integrity and confidentiality through cryptography techniques. This will provide the server to identify if the received information was tampered or from an unknown source.","Roles: Full stack developer, Project manager.","Tech stack: Raspberry Pi 3 B, DHT11 sensor, Python, Flask, VueJS, Wireshark, Kali Linux, WebSocket, Heroku."]},"gallery":{"title":"Project Highlights","photos":[]},"contact":{"title":"Contact for partnerships or proposals","links":[{"type":"email","svg":"socialMediaEmailCircleIcon","url":"davishinjik@gmail.com"},{"type":"linkedin","svg":"socialMediaLinkedinCircleIcon","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davikawasaki/"}]},"footer":{"text":"© Since 2017.
