Maybe global peace? For me all of that fidgets me to the bones, making me wonder: what can I do to assist in the achievement of such pseudo-utopic defiances?","In the everlasting discovery journey that I hike, my daily constant goal has been always trying to tackle such entanglements on a microscopical level, figuring out and solving problems from within, so that the accomplishments can outcrop to the outside. This philosophy of life is what I take from my personal life to my professional projects, seeking for a balance between excellence and empathy."]},"curriculum":{"title":"Brief Portifolio","education":{"title":"Education","svg":"graduationIcon","text":["[2014-2018] Bachelors in Computer Engineering coursed in UTFPR, Brazil","[2010-2013] Technical in Electrotechnics coursed in UTFPR, Brazil"]},"languages":{"title":"Languages","svg":"globeIcon","text":["Portuguese, Native | English, Fluent","Spanish, Intermediary | Danish, Basics","Japanese, Basics"]},"work":{"title":"Experiences","svg":"workIcon","text":["[2018-Now] IT Specialist at DSV XPress, Denmark","[2018-2018] Full stack developer at Lets Comunicação e Desenvolvimento, Brazil","[2016-2017] Co-founder and Design Manager at RAIS Health, Brazil","[2014-2016] Founder and Voluntary Coordinator at ELLP Group, Brazil","[2012-2015] Webdesigner at Ligue Site Cornélio Procópio, Brazil"]},"awards":{"title":"Experiences","svg":"ribbonIcon","text":["[2017] Rotary Club Recognition for Best Computer Engineering Student in Cornélio Procópio, Brazil","[2015] 1st place, TOTVS Agrobusiness Hackathon in Assis, Brazil","[2015] 1st place, Urban Mobility Hackathon in Londrina, Brazil"]}},"projects":{"title":"Projects","anchorTitles":"Read more..."},"blog":{"title":"Check my latest blog posts","anchorTitles":"Read more...","moreTitles":"More posts at","links":[{"name":"medium","svg":"socialMediaMediumCircleIcon","url":"https://medium.com/@davi.kawasaki"}]}},"common":{"footer":{"text":"© Since 2017.
