This meant the creation of a spin-off in Maringá State University (UEM, in portuguese) by one of our ex-members, as well as partnership in some festivals such as CINEURGE.","Roles: Co-founder, designer, manager, keynote speaker.","Tech stack: Photoshop, Illustrator, Social Media."]},"gallery":{"title":"Project Highlights","photos":[]},"contact":{"title":"Contact for partnerships or proposals","links":[{"type":"email","svg":"socialMediaEmailCircleIcon","url":"davishinjik@gmail.com"},{"type":"linkedin","svg":"socialMediaLinkedinCircleIcon","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davikawasaki/"}]},"footer":{"text":"© Since 2017.
