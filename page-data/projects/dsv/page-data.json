Besides that achievement, other relevant contributions to the local department were executed, such as: efficiency improvement on projects (less resources and faster execution time), better organization of technical tasks and processes (using modern and agile tools), standardization of processes and documentation (more comprehensible code patterns and faster maintenance deliverables), agile and constant innovations (modern technology implementation), more stable and reliable automation applications (update from outdated solution stack and establishment of best practices).","Roles: Trainee, full stack developer, DevOps, solutions architect.","Tech stack: Photoshop, Office Stack, Diagram, Atlassian Stack, Git, VBA, Bash Shell Scripts, .NET (Framework and Core), ReactJS, Ant Design, Python, Javascript, SQL Server, Microsoft Server 2016, Microsoft Teams, Kofax Kapowl, PAM Access Management."]},"gallery":{"title":"Project Highlights","photos":[]},"contact":{"title":"Contact for partnerships or proposals","links":[{"type":"email","svg":"socialMediaEmailCircleIcon","url":"davishinjik@gmail.com"},{"type":"linkedin","svg":"socialMediaLinkedinCircleIcon","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davikawasaki/"}]},"footer":{"text":"© Since 2017.
