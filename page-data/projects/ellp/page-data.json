In this way, both parties can have a good and fun time, where knowledge can be spread and impact communities.","Being a founder of the group in 2012 and ending my participation in the end of 2016, several topics were developed and achieved. Starting from teaching the platform Kodu Game Lab to a single class of 6 primary school students, the group has evolved to semiannual diverse technological topic-related classes with more than 50 students and still persists nowadays with different students from all different social backgrounds.","Contributing with teaching and management of the group projects, me and the other co-founders were able to be recognized in August 2015 by the Mapa Educação movement as one of the 100th best projects with capacity to impact and change the brazilian education.","Roles: Founder, manager, teacher, designer.","Teaching tools: Kodu Game Lab, Lego Mindstorms, MIT Scratch, MIT App Inventor."]},"gallery":{"title":"Project Highlights","photos":[{"parentFolders":"projects/ellp/","id":"ellp_mapa_educacao_2015_banner.jpg","about":"Banner presentation of ELLP Group activities at the 1st Mapa Educação Conference in 2015.
