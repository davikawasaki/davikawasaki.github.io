            "The group is composed of university students ecstatic about technology and open to offer voluntary education classes from specific technological themes to other exact science topics.",
            "Leveraging ludic and practical classes, our students can learn some advanced topics through practice, always with the help of a voluntary teacher. In this way, both parties can have a good and fun time, where knowledge can be spread and impact communities.",

Starting from teaching the platform Kodu Game Lab to a single class of 6 primary school students, the group has evolved to semiannual diverse technological topic-related classes with more than 50 students and still persists nowadays with different students from all different social backgrounds.",
            "Contributing with teaching and management of the group projects, me and the other co-founders were able to be recognized in August 2015 by the Mapa Educação movement as one of the 100th best projects with capacity to impact and change the brazilian education.",
