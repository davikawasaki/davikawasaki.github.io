Through an educational context and adaptive learning usage, the work develops an approach that goes from questions acquisition to the realization of supervised learning methods.","Ultimately, the final balanced model analysis presented a precision average of 79% for all algorithm methods and a precision of 83% for Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Besides using output model for future questions classification in an adaptive system, the work also managed to make a question database available with extracted and classified questions for computer teaching institutions.","Roles: Data Engineer, Developer.","Tech stack: Python, Natural Language Toolkit, MongoDB."]},"gallery":{"title":"Project Highlights","photos":[]},"contact":{"title":"Contact for partnerships or proposals","links":[{"type":"email","svg":"socialMediaEmailCircleIcon","url":"davishinjik@gmail.com"},{"type":"linkedin","svg":"socialMediaLinkedinCircleIcon","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davikawasaki/"}]},"footer":{"text":"© Since 2017.
