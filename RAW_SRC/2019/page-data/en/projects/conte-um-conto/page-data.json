At the end of their journey, students could get a final PDF version of their writings compiled into a digital book, graduating them as young writers.","As a co-founder, the work from the middle of 2017 to the beginning of 2018 was to gather requirements and ideas for the voluntary development team, convert the ideas into wireframes as well as establish partnerships with institutions to use this tool in their education systems.","Roles: Co-founder, designer UI/UX, full stack developer and manager.","Tech stack: Photoshop, Wireframes, Git, VueJS, NodeJS, SASS, Asana, Scrum."]},"gallery":{"title":"Project Highlights","photos":[]},"contact":{"title":"Contact for partnerships or proposals","links":[{"type":"email","svg":"socialMediaEmailCircleIcon","url":"mailto:davishinjik@gmail.com"},{"type":"linkedin","svg":"socialMediaLinkedinCircleIcon","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davikawasaki/"}]},"footer":{"text":"© Since 2017.
